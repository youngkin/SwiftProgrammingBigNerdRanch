/* Key points:
 *  1. Automatic initializer inheritance, initializers inherited from a superclass.
 *      Occurs when a class specified default values for subclass specific properties but
 *      Doesn't have any designated initializers of its own. Can apply to convenience
 *      initializers as well.
 *
 *      Interestingly enough the subclass, Zombie in this case, doesn't have to actually
 *      define the initializer. It gets it for free from the superclass.
 *  2. Designated initializers - ensure that all of a class's properties are intialized
 *  3. Convenience initializers - take only arguments that can't be defaulted and then
 *      they delegate all intialization responsibility to a designated initializer.
 *  4. Required initializers - specified as required in the superclass, requires that all
 *      subclasses implement these initializers.
 *  5. Deinitialization - same as a C/C++ destructor, similar to a Java finalizer
