    // parameter. By default the parameter is passed by value. Adding the 'mutating' qualifier
    // modifies the generation of the type method to specify that the parameter is an 'inout'
    // parameter which allows modification of the parameter. It's interesting that when calling
    // a 'mutating' method on a struct instance that you don't have to qualify it with a '&' as
    // you do with other 'inout' arguments.
